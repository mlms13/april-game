# The Game of April

No one really knows what this is going to be yet, but I'm pretty sure the theme ended up being "turn-based". My ideas are pretty limited so far, so this will probably sound like most of my other game ideas.

### Brainstorm

Each turn:

- Both players spend money
  - Repair damaged buildings
  - Buy more vehicles
  - Build new towers
  - Upgrades?
- Attacking player plans route
  - Select a group of units
  - Choose a series of waypoints, or...
  - Maybe there are just 3 pre-defined routes to choose from
- Send attack
  - Vehicles travel along the path
  - Opposing towers shoot at them
  - Defender receives money for each vehicle they take out
  - Attacker earns money for each vehicle that makes it to the base
